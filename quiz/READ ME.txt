quiz program is a nice multiple question test.
(that i have made for my children).
in this example i have created a english/hebrew exam/test.
you can change the subject of the exam/test by changing the "activity.json" file
this is the format of the json file ("activity.json"). 

	{
	"question":"this is the question",
	"option1":"this is the right answer",
	"option2":"this is the wrong answer",
	"option3":"this is the wrong answer"
	}

the java script file "controller.js" mix the answer, so every time the question appear, 
the oreder of the answer change randomly.
it sum the right answer and the wrong answer
and display it at the end of the exam/test.
("report web page")

enjoy .
